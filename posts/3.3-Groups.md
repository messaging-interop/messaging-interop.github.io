How do I talk to multiple people? Introductions and group conversations are closely related ideas.

Protons use MLS to ensure the security of group conversations.

Each MLS client needs to be represented by an identity public key. Following the model of protons that represent an end of a 1:1 relationship, a group $$G$$ has members (clients) represented by a group proton $$GP_i$$ with the structure for a given $$G_c$$

- For each other group member $$GP_i$$:
	 - A human-readable identity:
		- A string representing a preferred name
		* (Optional) pronouns
		* (Optional) A profile picture - could be emoji, monogram, or photo
	* An Identity Public Key ($$IPK_i$$)
		* Optionally, an external resource that attests to a link between $$IPK_i$$ and some external identity (e.g. a scoped username - B on Twitter)
	* A list of transport mechanisms (minimum 2), that each contains
	* A well-known url representing the service identity and configuration:
		*  E.g. signal.org/.well-known/Proton.json
	* A long-term delivery address (this facilitates recovery)
		* With a guaranteed valid until date
  - An ephemeral delivery address for $$P_b$$
    - With a (nearer) guaranteed valid until date
- An Identity private key for $$IPK_c$$ corresponding to the $$IPK_i$$ held by other group members
  - A set of associations of $$IPK_c$$ with other related protons (relationships)defined by cryptographic attestation - see [Identity].
- An Identity private key for $$GP_c$$ corresponding to the $$IPK_c$$ held by other members of the group
- Message Security state variables
	- This is the MLS cryptographic state. [^1]

In MLS terminology:
- A Group Proton is a client of a group.
- Each relationship manager’s understanding of how it got the proton’s identity key is the authentication service
- The delivery service is decentralized - each client is responsible for distributing messages, and publishing keys and pre-keys for new joiners
	- Proton groups may enlist the use of an Attestation Service to publish self-add pre-keys.
	- Proton groups may enlist the use of a server as the delivery service, to fan out messages and enforce a canonical ordering of epochs. The section on [sending services](/posts/6.3-Sending-Service) describes this.

### Introductions
The act of adding participants to a group can be thought of an introduction, brokered by the person performing the add, between the new participants and the existing participants. To better understand the mechanics, let’s look at the example of Alex, who has relationships with Blair and Charlie, and wants to introduce them.


Alex has two relationships AB and CB. Note that Alex has two independent cryptographic identities - Alex as Blair knows them ($$P_{AtoB}$$), and Alex as Charlie knows them($$P_{AtoC}$$)

![Diagram of the start condition, where Alex has two independent relationships](/img/330.png)

Figure 3.3.0

Alex can introduce Blair and Charlie by starting a group thread between the three of them:

(For shorthand, we will refer to a Proton interchangeably with its IPK. Most of these actions will be automatd by Alex's software.)

- Alex generates a new IPK for their identity in this group, $$GP_A$$ 
	- Alex sends $$GP_A$$  in AB and CB, and attests to a parallel relationship between $$GP_A$$ and the cryptographic identities Blair and Charlie already know for Alex - $$P_{A to B}$$ and $$P_{A to C}$$, respectively.
- Alex also generates placeholder identities for Blair ($$GP_{AB}$$) and Charlie ($$GP_{AC}$$), and sends the respective public and private keys to Blair and Charlie.
	- That is, Alex sends in $$AB$$ the public key for $$GP_{AC}$$ and the private key for $$GP_{AB}$$, and symmetrically for $$AC$$.
	- This step is required because we do not want to reuse cryptographic identities in different conversations, and allows Alex to asynchronously start a group without relying on Blair and Charlie to generate a new key pair. In any case, Blair and Charlie should not assume that Alex does not hold on to the private keys to the placeholder identities.
- Alex also generates new long-term addresses for Blair and Charlie, derived from the addresses in AB and AC, and sends them along with the placeholder identities.

- All three participants now have the necessary info to send each other bidirectional messages. The combination of cryptographic identity and address (plus additional metadata) form a group proton for each participant.
- Alex completes the introduction by forming an MLS group with the group protons $$GP_A$$, $$GP_{AB}$$, and $$GP_{AC}$$

The state of this group is "Alex has created a group of 3, including 2 invitees Alex asserts to be Blair and Charlie"

Figure 3.3.1

If Blair accepts,
- Blair should immediately generate a new identity key $$GP_B$$.
- Blair should attest to Alex that $$GP_B$$ is equivalent to the existing identity $$P_{B to A}$$.
- In the group, Blair should use  $$GP_{AB}$$ to attest that it will be followed by $$GP_B$$, add $$GP_B$$ to the group, and propose to remove itself. $$GP_B$$  can send the commit message to remove the placeholder

Charlie can similarly replace its placeholder, resulting in the following state:

Figure 3.3.2

Blair and Charlie do not have any new trust that these introduced identities are not aliases for Alex, but they can now independently do so, either by verifying the identities directly, or asserting equivalence to other identities they may exchange.

Lastly, Blair and Charlie can assert equivalence between their group protons with an new, individual proton, to start a 1:1 relationship:

### Merging Relationships

Blair and Charlie can build trust in this relationship with additional introductions.

Suppose that Blair and Charlie also have a mutual acquaintance Dani, who introduces them, producing two relationships with low trust.

![Parallel Relationships](/img/334.png)
Figure 3.3.4

Blair and Charlie can perhaps guess, based on preferred name and contextual clues, that this is the same relationship. But merging has to be consensual - both to preserve consistent message ordering on both sides of the conversation, and to allow people agency over separation of their identities. If Charlie asks to merge the threads, Blair may be unable to - the protons may be actually handled by different relationship managers (e.g. in a work/personal separation) on possibly different devices. Or Blair may simply choose not to.

Let’s say that Charlie initiates the merge. Charlie should attest that $$P_{C via A}$$ and $$P_{C via D}$$ are equivalent, and both should be followed by a new identity $$P_C$$
 and send the attestation to both  $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$ .
- If Blair has already attested that $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$  are equivalent, e.g. by equivalence to a key in an external directory, then the merge is just a request to be negotiated between Charlie and Blair.
	- Charlie says, effectively “You told me  $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$  are the same. I am now telling you $$P_{C via A}$$ and $$P_{C via D}$$  are the same, and I’d like to just use $$P_C$$ to talk to a unified identity for you”
	- Blair can consent, and generate a $$P_B$$ that follows  $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$ , or ignore the request and continue with separate threads.
	- Charlie’s relationship manager can still collapse the conversations visually for convenience (e.g. by threading), but they remain two logically separate conversations between equivalent identities.
- If Blair has not attested to the equivalence of their identities, Charlie should start a group with $$P_C$$, $$P_{B via A}$$, and $$P_{B via D}$$ (effectively, introducing  $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$ )
	- Charlie effectively says: My identities ($$P_{C via A}$$ and $$P_{C via D}$$) were representations of the same identity. I’m introducing $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$  and I think you may be the same identity”

![Charlie attempts to merge the two threads](/img/335.png)

Figure 3.3.5

Blair can agree and assert the equivalence of $$P_{B via A}$$ and $$P_{B via D}$$ and symmetrically designate a new follow-on merged identity.

If Alex had maliciously inserted themselves into the introduced relationship BC via A, that is:

![An attempted merge if one of the aliases is a malicous introducer alias](/img/336.png)

Figure 3.3.6

Then Charlie’s attempt to merge the introduced relationships would result in introducing $$P_{B via D}$$ to $$P_{A\ middle}$$, as the purported pair of $$P_{CviaA}$$. Assuming that $$P_{BviaA}$$ and $$P_{BviaD}$$ are managed by the same relationship manager, which expects $$P_{BviaA}$$ to be in a relationship with $$P_{CviaA}$$, this immediately flags Alex as a meddler.

Unless Dani and Alex collude, this is a mechanism for Blair and Charlie to detect that their relationship derived from Alex should not be trusted.
