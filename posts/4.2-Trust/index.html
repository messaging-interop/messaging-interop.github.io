      <h1>4.2. Trust</h1>

      <p>The privacy of my messages - in transit and after receipt - relies on trust in many different parties, including the other party to a relationship.</p>
<p>The proton architecture guarantees that people are exchanging messages with (and only with) who they expect to be talking to, and that they are transmitted with ephemeral addresses. It makes no promises about what happens after the message is received, how many devices the recipient is running, or even if the recipient is running a hosted service where a server stores their signing keys. We should not exclude people from this architecture who - for a variety of reasons - do not use device-bound identities. They may not have a device, or have sufficient trust in their device security or recovery methods.</p>
<p>A very useful property of some messaging apps is ephemerality - that messages disappear after some time, and the client app makes it difficult for recipients to exfiltrate them - e.g. by screenshotting. For users to have an assurance of ephemerality, they need stronger assurances about the remote party's software.</p>
<p>Federated systems are unable to offer this guarantee. Users that desire this property should agree on a particular software client, which implements its own transport security atop the proton relationship. These clients have several technologies available to attest to each other what client software they are running, like video games which do so to raise difficulty of cheating. Operating systems may assist with this attestation, as iOS does<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
