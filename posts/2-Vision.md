What does messaging look like if we center them on a conversation atop a relationship?

**Start relationships anywhere:** People meet in many different venues and communities, in-person and online. I should be able to start a conversation in any of those places, including bootstrapping from existing conversations.
- **Start relationships in person**
- **Start relationships by introduction**
	If Alex has relationships with Blair and Charlie, Alex can introduce Blair and Charlie to each other
- **Start relationships from a directory**
	This may be a public directory or an access controlled one.

**Relationships are consensual:**	I can revoke a person’s permission to contact me.

**Relationships are portable:** I can change devices and software services, and I can safely and automatically update my relationships with new addresses - becuase identities are not based on addresses.

**Relationships are independent:** My identities in different relationships are not linkable unless I choose to make them so. E.g. in a specific context - social group, work, or school, all those individuals expect to know me by the same identity, and those conversations are expected to be linkable. But the conversations I have with my doctor and my employer don’t need to be linkable.

**Relationships are not dependent on a single app or service**

**Conversations are secure and private:** Messages in a conversation are transmitted with end to end encryption. Messages are transmitted with ephemeral identifiers.

**Conversations are multi-modal:** I can send different kinds of messages in the same conversation (e.g. a payment, a long mail, or a short text), and I can use other apps to communicate through this relationship in new and novel ways.

**Relationships don’t require both parties to use the same app or service**

### How would people use this system?
Alex meets Blair in a running club. They exchange contact info with a tap of their phones, which lets them start a digital relationship and a conversation that spans texts, email, and real-time calls. Blair can send Alex a payment for post-race coffee within the same conversation.

Blair knows some other runners, and introduces Alex to Charlie and Dani. Alex and Charlie hit it off, but Alex doesn’t want to continue the relationship with Dani. Alice chooses to block Dani, and Dani can’t try to recontact Alex. If Blair insists on reintroducing Dani to Alex, Alex can choose to ignore introductions from Blair, short of wholly blocking Blair.

Alex starts school, and now has a new set of relationships with everyone at school via the school directory. Blair is a student too, but the digital conversations don’t automatically reveal if Blair in the school directory is the same Blair from the running club. Alex can ask Blair to join the school and running conversations. Or perhaps they’d like to keep those parts of ourselves separate, and keep parallel conversations.

Alex builds a close friendship with Emery from school. Emery graduates and is no longer in the school directory, but the relationship remains. They can continue their conversation without a new exchange of addresses, even as the school no longer attests to Emery’s identity as a current student. If Emery was also relying on the school to provide their messaging service (as people often do with email), they can sign up for a new service, and Emery’s client software can automatically and safely update Emery’s relationships with a new address - in a way that is not safe to automatically update my contacts with a new phone number or email address - because the delivery addresses they use are no longer their identity.

Alex starts a relationship with a merchant in a similar way. This allows the merchant to contact Alex with time-sensitive (order notification, 2FA codes) and slow messages (newsletters). These time-sensitive messages could also be forwarded to the merchant’s app (e.g. an app-delegated login - like Duo or the Blizzard authenticator) instead of being handed as a text message. Alice can also message or call the business from this same authenticated identity, without having to manually authenticate or provide authentication information over an untrusted channel.

All this happens without any of us having to exchange phone numbers or email addresses, or to update them over time with our relationships.
