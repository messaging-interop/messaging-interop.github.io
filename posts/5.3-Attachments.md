The proton architecture is intended for store and forward messages that contain encoded text, keys, and URI's resulting from a human action. Data that does not fit, like images, should be sent in an attachment flow that only needs to be standardized between relationship managers.

The RM message format must include a format for attachments that specifies:
- the encryption and integrity key(s)
- URI for the ciphertext
  - duration of validity of the URI

Messages that do not fit in a maximum proton message size (e.g. long emails, or many attachments), can be encoded and sent as an attachment.

Users should generally rely on their receiving and sending services, as the last hop from the device, for hosting and retrieving blob content. Sketches of implementations:

### Sending Services
Sending services can provide users with a resource to upload arbitrary ciphertexts and host them for a fixed duration, under some quota policy.

### Receiving Services
Users should not generally directly fetch resources from arbitrary servers from their device(s). Receiving services can proxy or cache attachments on behalf of the recipient.
