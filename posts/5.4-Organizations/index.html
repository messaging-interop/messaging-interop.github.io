      <h1>5.4. Organizational Identity</h1>

      <p>Protons solve a number of problems or businesses (or any organization) that communicate with individuals, for which a phone number is a poor abstraction for the many entities (and vendors) that comprise an organization.</p>
<p>My bank has many phone numbers. There are many scammers who call me posing as my bank, or as a social security agency. People are also habituated to providing authenticating information over the phone, a rich target for phishing.</p>
<p>Organizations today already have a way of establishing a cryptographic identity - through a CA for a domain. Which while imperfect, is a robust claim that a key belongs to Bank of America. And while I might look on the Bank of America website to check that a phone number is actually theirs, attestation and associated identities allow Bank of America to define some set of identities representing different functional teams - their fraud resolution, customer service.</p>
<p>Businesses, like consumers, are also facing a fracturing of their messaging platforms as competing services offer B2C platforms, indexed on the same phone number. Should a business send an SMS, or a platform's variety of message, or blast the customer on all of them? A proton, as a representation of a single relationship, means that senders need to only worry about the priority and mode of the message - to include a push notification to their own app, not which client App the user is more likely to use.</p>
<p>The assumption that sending frequency is capped at the rate of a human's activity is mostly relevant to the relationship between senders devices and their sending service. Organizations are not likely to have device-bound identities, and will likely use a vendor which integrates the relationship manager, and sending and receiving services in a hosted platform. From a receiving service's standpoint, this vendor's sending service that is responsible for all of an organization's B2C relationships, still looks like a well-behaved sending service as it will be sending well-addressed and correctly signed messages to distinct recipients.</p>
<p>Some allowance might need to made for burst activity (push notification updates to sports scores, perhaps), but that can be resolved non-technically with arrangements between receiving and sending services of sufficient volume that such bursts are an issue.</p>
