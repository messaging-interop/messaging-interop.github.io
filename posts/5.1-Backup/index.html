      <h1>5.1. Backup</h1>

      <p>People need to be able to continue their conversations if they lose their devices and the data on them. Today, this happens because identities (phone numbers and email addresses) are recoverable by appeal to the authority of the service provider, and often some form of contacts or implicit contacts (in message history) are escrowed with some service providers.</p>
<p>So today, services can impersonate you (in practice, be convinced to allow someone to impersonate - for example in a SIM swap attack), and know who you talk to.</p>
<p>Photon Relationships can be backed up in a variety of ways reflecting different tradeoffs of recovery and security. Most users, who have cryptographic identities stored securely on their devices, should never escrow their device-stored private keys - compromise of private keys would allow an attacker to impersonate the user.</p>
<p>We have technologies shipping at scale today that preserve end to end security and allow users to recover their secrets from other devices in a sync circle, or from an escrowed store protected by a secret only the user knows. There are also shipping technologies where users can back up their private data using shared secrets so that no one party can recover the user's data.[^1] These methods would be safe to store private keys and allow me to recover from loss of a device without disturbing my relationships. I lose my phone, I recover my relationships from my desktop, and life continues.</p>
<p>There are users who do not have devices, who today authenticate to online services with a user secret, and rely on the honest behavior of their service providers to not impersonate them. These users should also be able to participate in Photon relationships, but their relationship manager must be honest in representing that these userâ€™s identities are escrowed and not device bound.</p>
<p>The <a href="docs/recovery.html">documentation</a> outlines a method of backing up relationships without exposing private keys, or being dependent on a user secret for recovery.</p>
